- 👋 Hi, I’m @adamresemius
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about software development and new techniques, and learn to problem solve with ways to code.
- Currently I know the basics of python, c++, and java. I understand the fundamentals of OOP and agile frameworks. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about different frameworks and development styles such as Scrum-agile and waterfall.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that I can contribute to, I want to learn more about coding and maybe get a sponsor to help me learn.
- 📫 How to reach me at adamjresemius@gmail.com
